# PEWLETT HACKARD ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to identify how many employees from Pewlett-Hackard will be retiring soon. To fully respond the question at hand the data is filtered by age, hiring date, department, title, management and salary. By answering this question PH can prepare for a 'silver tsunami'. Although an obvious solution to the issue is to start recruiting new people, PH must also consider their younger employees they currently have and contemplate the possibility of a mentorship program to retain talent.

## RESULTS

The first step was to create an ERD to understand the relationship between the six databases presented.

During the analysis it was found that the following positions will become open:

* Although some positions such as Staff and Assistant could be easily be filled by new hirees, there are others that would require professionals that have had some experience in the company, such as Senior Engineer and Managers. The latter positions would benefit from a mentorship program. Instead of having to hire an external senior engineer who is also probably older, PH could start a mentorship program for younger employees who already have experience within the company to take over those positions.

* That being said, most of the upcoming openings will be for senior positions. PH will have to hire new people for these departments as well. PH should prioritize Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions getting filled.

* Although there are two management positions opening up and it will be crucial to have adequate management, the larger issue at hand is the other positions opening up. PH should consider promoting somebody younger with a considerable amount of experience for these positions and focus on the gap the other departments are imminently going to have.

The second part of the analysis looked at the posibility of a mentorship program:

* There are only 1,549 employees elegible for a mentorship program. Given the previous chart it is clear that there is not enough people to solve the 'silver tsunami' with a mentorship program alone. That being said, PH should take advantage of every oportunity they have to train current junior employees and retain company knowledge through the process of a mentorship program.

## SUMMARY

###### HOW MANY ROLES WILL NEED TO BE FILLED AS THE 'SILVER TSUNAMI' BEGINS TO MAKE AN IMPACT?

PH need to fill 72,458 positions as the 'silver tsunami' makes an impact. 
Given that this analysis was meant to look into current employees eligible for retirement, PH should brace for the next generation of employees who will be retiring. Although the age bracket analyzed is a major one, it is not clear what the retirement eligibility will be for people close to it but not quite there. Another query worth looking into is how younger employees have moved within the company. This would help PH identify who are the best prospects to fill in the upcoming gaps. Seniority for younger employees would also shed light into which are the best candidates to get promoted and help PH avoid the tsunami.

###### ARE THERE ENOUGH QUALIFIED, RETIREMENT-READY EMPLOYEES IN THE DEPARTMENTS TO MENTOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF PH EMPLOYEES?

There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of PH employees. Because of this, it is important that PH takes advantage of their current staffing through a mentorship program to retain talent. If the company sees a lot of openings and work getting dumped over to other people, their current staffing could become overwhelmed, leading them to quit. It is in PH best interest to keep as much people as possible to avoid a disturbance in their workflow. That being said, it is evident that the company will have to prepare to hire a lot of people. A possible solution would be to consider which positions can be filled by people working from home. Having to hire people to work in a presential way may mean that they have topay for moving expenses for example. Hiring people from outerstate, or even internationally, could help PH curve the number of vacant positions in their favor.
